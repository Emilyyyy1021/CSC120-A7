Use this file to record your reflection on this assignment.

- Which methods did you decide to `overload`, and why?

I overload the class with only the building's name and floor number, because the school could be planning to build a new building but we haven't find a place(address) to. 

I overload the goToFloor() method with a double input, so that if the user entered a double accidentally, the method will round it into int, and go to that floor

- What worked, what didn't, what advice would you give someone taking this course in the future?

I do not understand why the subclasses started to say somthing like, "The public type Cafe must be defined in its own file". This is actually fixed when I reopened the files. 
Although I am not sure if my approach of overloading the method is correct, it seems to work.
